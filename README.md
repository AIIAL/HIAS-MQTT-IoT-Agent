# Introduction

A **HIAS IoT Agent** is a bridge between HIAS network devices and applications, and the HIASCDI Contextual Data Interface. The **HIAS MQTT IoT Agent** is a HIAS AI Agent that communicates with HIAS devices and applications using the MQTT machine to machine communication protocol.

&nbsp;

# MQTT

The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight machine to machine communication protocol designed to provide communication between low resource devices.

The protocol is publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) communication protocol that runs over the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP).

&nbsp;

# HIAS

![HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](assets/images/hias-network.jpg)

[HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](https://github.com/AIIAL/HIAS-Core) is an open-source automation server designed to control and manage an intelligent network of IoT connected devices and applications.

## HIAS IoT Agents

The HIAS iotJumpWay Agents are a selection of protocol/transfer specific applications that act as a bridge between the **HIASCDI Contextual Data Interface** & the **HIASHDI Historical Data Interface** and the devices and applications connected to the HIAS network via the iotJumpWay. Supported protocols currently include **HTTP**, **MQTT**, **Websockets**, **AMQP** and **Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.

Each IoT Agent provides a North & South Port interface that allows communication to and from the Context Broker.

The North Port interface of an IoT Agent listens to southbound traffic coming from the Context Broker towards the devices and applications.

__Source: [FIWARE IoT Agents](https://fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/iot-agent/index.html)__

The IoT Agent sends southbound traffic to devices and applications using a protocol that is supported by the device/application, and receives northbound traffic from the devices/applications which it then forwards to the Context Broker.
